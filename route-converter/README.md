# Route file generator

`converter.js` records event and generate a final `route.txt` file that our zkp platform accepts as input.

## Usage

1. Open game

2. Press F12 for console, and copy content in `converter.js` into console to execute

3. Replay your route (either from .h5route, or from a savedata and replaying from beginning)

4. Beat the boss and "win" (you can change your hp to 1e8 to force the battle to happen)

5. Collect `route.txt` and use it as zkp route input
